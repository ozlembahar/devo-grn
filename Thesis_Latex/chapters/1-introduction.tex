\section{Motivation}
Neurogenesis...

The relatively simple central nervous system (CNS) of the Drosophila embryo
provides a useful model system for investigating the mechanisms that generate and pattern complex nervous systems (Segment polarity genes in neuroblast formation and identity specification during Drosophila neurogenesis) - motivation?

Modeling of GRN limitations and why SC-data can help (importance of data driven GRN inferring)....


Traditionally, GRNs are reconstructed gene by gene, by experimental data. ...
High trhroughput sequencing opens the potential for large GRNs reconstruction. 

This thesis offers an approach of complementing a Boolean model GRN with SC-rna seq data. 

% The neurogenesis process in Drosophila melanogaster serves as a quintessential model for understanding the fundamental aspects of nervous system development across species.

\section{Research Structure}
A gene regulatory network was inferred from single cell RNA sequencing data using SCENIC workflow. Then used to extend an existing Boolean model.
